# server/src/rules

This folder contains rules modules and the draft Rules API.

- `types.js`: JSDoc typedefs for the rules interface.
- `pacer-lite.js`: initial placeholder rules module (not yet integrated into runtime).

See [docs/RULES_API.md](../../docs/RULES_API.md) for the draft interface and integration plan.
